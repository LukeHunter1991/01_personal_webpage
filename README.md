## Description

I decided to create a personal webpage as a simple way to show my work online. As I continue to complete projects each week I wanted to create a webpage that can show my portfolio while itself showcasing some of the skills that I have learned. In building this project I improved my skills with HTML and CSS. Specifically, I learned a lot about general layout/styling practices to help my webpage look professional at different screen sizes, including utilising media queries. I also greatly improved my knowledge of pseudo classes to help make my page more responsive and interactive.
